# Game details
In our game there are 23 stages which we want to place a set of robots at each stage.

The teams of robots will have a set size of between 1-5 robots per game.

Each game lasts 30 or 60 seconds.

For each robot, real-time traffic planning is done so that at the end of the game the robots will collect a maximum amount of coins.

# Game options
The first option is a manual game where we place the robots and tell where each robot will go to collect the coins.

A second option is an automatic game that when we run it the bots are placed right in a strategic place that can collect the money and earn a maximum score together.

The robots in the second type of game move alone without having to tell them where to move and collect the coins.
